# [hey76](http://hey76.herokuapp.com/)

## Summary
hey76 is a media aggregator on NBA draft candidates built on Ruby on Rails. The primary frontend libraries used in this project are Twitter Typeahead and React.js. The data concerning the draft candidates come from three sources: Bing Search, Twitter, and Instagram. Get started by navigating to http://hey76.herokuapp.com/ and typing in the name of a draft candidate. Once you search for a draft candidate the app will redirect the user to a draft candidate's individual page, where the most recent information on the candidate will appear in chronological order from left to right and top to bottom.
***Instagram posts after a certain period do not appear after Instagram's API policy change***

```ruby
draft candidates = ["Ben Simmons", "Brandon Ingram", "Jaylen Brown", "Dragan Bender", "Kris Dunn", "Buddy Hield", "Jamal Murray", "marquese Chriss", "Jakob Poeltl", "Thon Maker"] 
```

## Deployment
hey76 is running on Heroku.
